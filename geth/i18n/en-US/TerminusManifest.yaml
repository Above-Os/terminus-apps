  description: Run a node at home, the easy way.
spec:
  fullDescription: "This is an official Golang execution layer implementation of the\
    \ Ethereum protocol. \nTake full control. \nRun your own node. \nBecome fully\
    \ sovereign while helping secure the network.\nBecome Ethereum. \n\nChoosing to\
    \ run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to.\
    \ \n\nRunning a full node:  \n* Supports the resilience and censorship resistance\
    \ of Ethereum-based networks \n* Authoritatively validates all transactions \n\
    * Can interact with any contract on the public blockchain without an intermediary\
    \ \n* Can directly deploy contracts into the public blockchain without an intermediary\
    \ \n* Can query (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.)\
    \ offline \n* Can query the blockchain without letting a third party know the\
    \ information you're reading \n\n# Be Aware # \nRunning a full node requires significant\
    \ and growing hardware and bandwidth resources, which will incur some mild to\
    \ moderate costs for you. A full node may download up to 300 GB of data (as of\
    \ March 2021, depending on the client configuration) and store it on a local hard\
    \ drive. This data burden increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions\
    \ and blocks are added. \n\nYou can check detail hardware requirements in the\
    \ link below. \nhttps://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/03clients.asciidoc#requirements\
    \ \n    \n# Who should run a node? # \nEveryone! Nodes are not just for proof-of-stake\
    \ \nvalidators. Anyone can run a node, you don't even need ETH. \n\nDon't trust.\
    \ \nVerify. \n"

    improved version is available from the new package ethclient/simulated. A backwards-compatibility

    wrapper remains in the old location. (#28202)


    - Fix ABI-encoding of negative big.Int in topics (#28764)


    - In JSON logging output, the "error" level is now correctly emitted as "error".

    (#28774, #28780)


    - Fixed an issue with configuration of stdlib package log for consumers of the

    geth library (#28747)
