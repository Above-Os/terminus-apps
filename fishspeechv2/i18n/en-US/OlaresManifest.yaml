    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Fish Speech is an open-source multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system with voice cloning capabilities. It provides high-quality TTS synthesis with support for multiple languages including English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.

    Key Features
    Zero-shot & Few-shot TTS: Input a 10 to 30-second vocal sample to generate high-quality TTS output.

    Multilingual & Cross-lingual Support: Simply copy and paste multilingual text into the input box—no need to worry about the language. Currently supports English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.

    No Phoneme Dependency: The model has strong generalization capabilities and does not rely on phonemes for TTS. It can handle text in any language script.

    Highly Accurate: Achieves a low CER (Character Error Rate) of around 0.4% and WER (Word Error Rate) of around 0.8% for Seed-TTS Eval.

    Fast: Accelerated by torch compile, the real-time factor is approximately 1:7 on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.

    WebUI Inference: Features an easy-to-use, Gradio-based web UI compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers.

    Speech Control: Supports a variety of emotional, tone, and special markers to enhance speech synthesis.
