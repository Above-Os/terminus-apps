  fullDescription: 'FaceChain is a novel framework for generating identity-preserved
    human portraits. In the newest FaceChain FACT (Face Adapter with deCoupled Training)
    version, with only 1 photo and 10 seconds, you can generate personal portraits
    in different settings (multiple styles now supported!). FaceChain has both high
    controllability and authenticity in portrait generation, including text-to-image
    and inpainting based pipelines, and is seamlessly compatible with ControlNet and
    LoRAs. You may generate portraits via FaceChain''s Python scripts, or via the
    familiar Gradio interface, or via sd webui. FaceChain is powered by ModelScope.
