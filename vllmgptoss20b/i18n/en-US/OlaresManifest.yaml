    ## MODEL OVERVIEW ##
    Welcome to the gpt-oss series, OpenAI’s open-weight models designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases.

    # Models:
    We’re releasing two flavors of these open models:
    gpt-oss-120b
    — for production, general purpose, high reasoning use cases that fit into a single 80GB GPU (like NVIDIA H100 or AMD MI300X) (117B parameters with 5.1B active parameters)

    gpt-oss-20b
    — for lower latency, and local or specialized use cases (21B parameters with 3.6B active parameters)

    Both models were trained on our harmony response format and should only be used with the harmony format as it will not work correctly otherwise.

    # Feature highlights
    - Permissive Apache 2.0 license: Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.
    - Configurable reasoning effort: Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.
    - Full chain-of-thought: Gain complete access to the model’s reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It’s not intended to be shown to end users.
    - Fine-tunable: Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.
    - Agentic capabilities: Use the models’ native capabilities for function calling, web browsing, Python code execution, and Structured Outputs.
    - MXFP4 quantization: The models were post-trained with MXFP4 quantization of the MoE weights, making gpt-oss-120b run on a single 80GB GPU (like NVIDIA H100 or AMD MI300X) and the gpt-oss-20b model run within 16GB of memory. All evals were performed with the same MXFP4 quantization.
