spec:
  fullDescription: |
    ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system that allows generating analytical data reports in real-time.
    
    Distinctive Features
    True Column-Oriented DBMS
    Stores values without extra data (like lengths). Data is stored compactly, even uncompressed, to maximize performance and minimize CPU usage during processing.
    
    Data Compression
    Uses efficient general-purpose and specialized compression codecs. This is a key factor for achieving high performance and reducing storage costs.
    
    Disk Storage with Indexing
    Data is physically sorted by a primary key, enabling low-latency range queries. Designed to work efficiently on regular hard drives (HDDs), but also leverages SSDs and RAM.
    
    Parallel & Distributed Processing
    Large queries are automatically parallelized across all CPU cores on a server. Supports distributed query processing across multiple shards (groups of replicas) transparently.
    
    SQL Support
    Uses a declarative query language based on SQL, mostly ANSI SQL compatible. (Note: Correlated subqueries were not supported at the time of writing).
    
    Vectorized Query Execution Engine
    Processes data by columns in vectors (parts of columns), leading to high CPU efficiency.
    
    Real-Time Data Inserts
    Supports incremental data ingestion into tables with a primary key using the MergeTree engine. New data is added without locks.
    
    Primary & Secondary Indexes
    Primary Index: Enables fast data retrieval based on sorted keys. Secondary Indexes​ (Data Skipping Indexes): Allow the database to skip reading data blocks that don't match query conditions.
    
    Suitable for Online Queries
    Aims for sub-second query latencies, making it suitable for interactive, online query processing as opposed to offline report generation.
    
    Support for Approximated Calculations
    Provides ways to trade accuracy for speed, including approximate aggregate functions, querying sampled data, and aggregating a limited number of random keys.
    
    Adaptive JOIN Algorithm
    Automatically chooses the optimal JOIN strategy (e.g., hash join or merge join) based on the table sizes involved in the query.
    
    Data Replication and Integrity
    Uses asynchronous multi-master replication. Data written to one replica is automatically copied to others, ensuring fault tolerance and automated recovery.
    
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    Implements user account management and access control using SQL, similar to standard RDBMS.
    
    Notable Considerations (Potential Disadvantages)
    Lacks full-fledged transactions. Not optimized for high-rate, low-latency updates/deletes of individual rows (though batch operations are available). Sparse indexing makes it less efficient for point queries retrieving single rows.
