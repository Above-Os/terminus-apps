spec:
  fullDescription: 'Paperless-ngx is a community-supported open-source document management
    system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive
    so you can keep, well, less paper.


    Features

    - Organize and index your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types,
    and more.

    - Your data is stored locally on your server and is never transmitted or shared
    in any way.


    - Performs OCR on your documents, adding searchable and selectable text, even
    to documents scanned with only images.


    - Utilizes the open-source Tesseract engine to recognize more than 100 languages.


    - Documents are saved as PDF/A format which is designed for long term storage,
    alongside the unaltered originals.


    - Uses machine-learning to automatically add tags, correspondents and document
    types to your documents.


    - Supports PDF documents, images, plain text files, Office documents (Word, Excel,
    Powerpoint, and LibreOffice equivalents)1 and more.


    - Paperless stores your documents plain on disk. Filenames and folders are managed
    by paperless and their format can be configured freely with different configurations
    assigned to different documents.


    - Beautiful, modern web application that features:

    * Customizable dashboard with statistics.

    * Filtering by tags, correspondents, types, and more.

    * Bulk editing of tags, correspondents, types and more.

    * Drag-and-drop uploading of documents throughout the app.

    * Customizable views can be saved and displayed on the dashboard and / or sidebar.

    * Support for custom fields of various data types.

    * Shareable public links with optional expiration.


    - Full text search helps you find what you need:

    * Auto completion suggests relevant words from your documents.

    * Results are sorted by relevance to your search query.

    * Highlighting shows you which parts of the document matched the query.

    * Searching for similar documents ("More like this")


    - Email processing1: import documents from your email accounts:

    * Configure multiple accounts and rules for each account.

    * After processing, paperless can perform actions on the messages such as marking
    as read, deleting and more.


    - A built-in robust multi-user permissions system that supports ''global'' permissions
    as well as per document or object.

    - A powerful workflow system that gives you even more control.

    - Optimized for multi core systems: Paperless-ngx consumes multiple documents
    in parallel.

    - The integrated sanity checker makes sure that your document archive is in good
    health.
