  fullDescription: |
    Paperless-ngx is a community-supported open-source document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper.

    Features
    - Organize and index your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types, and more.
    - Your data is stored locally on your server and is never transmitted or shared in any way.
    
    - Performs OCR on your documents, adding searchable and selectable text, even to documents scanned with only images.
    
    - Utilizes the open-source Tesseract engine to recognize more than 100 languages.
    
    - Documents are saved as PDF/A format which is designed for long term storage, alongside the unaltered originals.
    
    - Uses machine-learning to automatically add tags, correspondents and document types to your documents.
    
    - Supports PDF documents, images, plain text files, Office documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and LibreOffice equivalents)1 and more.
    
    - Paperless stores your documents plain on disk. Filenames and folders are managed by paperless and their format can be configured freely with different configurations assigned to different documents.
    
    - Beautiful, modern web application that features:
    * Customizable dashboard with statistics.
    * Filtering by tags, correspondents, types, and more.
    * Bulk editing of tags, correspondents, types and more.
    * Drag-and-drop uploading of documents throughout the app.
    * Customizable views can be saved and displayed on the dashboard and / or sidebar.
    * Support for custom fields of various data types.
    * Shareable public links with optional expiration.
    
    - Full text search helps you find what you need:
    * Auto completion suggests relevant words from your documents.
    * Results are sorted by relevance to your search query.
    * Highlighting shows you which parts of the document matched the query.
    * Searching for similar documents ("More like this")
    
    - Email processing1: import documents from your email accounts:
    * Configure multiple accounts and rules for each account.
    * After processing, paperless can perform actions on the messages such as marking as read, deleting and more.
    
    - A built-in robust multi-user permissions system that supports 'global' permissions as well as per document or object.
    - A powerful workflow system that gives you even more control.
    - Optimized for multi core systems: Paperless-ngx consumes multiple documents in parallel.
    - The integrated sanity checker makes sure that your document archive is in good health.
