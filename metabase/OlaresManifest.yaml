    Use the SQL editor for more complex queries.
    Build handsome, interactive dashboards with filters, auto-refresh, fullscreen, and custom click behavior.
    Create models that clean up, annotate, and/or combine raw tables.
    Define canonical segments and metrics for your team to use.
    Send data to Slack or email on a schedule with dashboard subscriptions.
    Set up alerts to have Metabase notify you when your data changes.
    Embed charts and dashboards in your app, or even your entire Metabase.
