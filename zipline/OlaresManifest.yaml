  fullDescription: |
    Zipline is a Pythonic algorithmic trading library. It is an event-driven system for backtesting. Zipline is currently used in production as the backtesting and live-trading engine powering Quantopian -- a free, community-centered, hosted platform for building and executing trading strategies. Quantopian also offers a fully managed service for professionals that includes Zipline, Alphalens, Pyfolio, FactSet data, and more.

    Features
    Ease of Use: Zipline tries to get out of your way so that you can focus on algorithm development. See below for a code example.
    "Batteries Included": many common statistics like moving average and linear regression can be readily accessed from within a user-written algorithm.
    PyData Integration: Input of historical data and output of performance statistics are based on Pandas DataFrames to integrate nicely into the existing PyData ecosystem.
    Statistics and Machine Learning Libraries: You can use libraries like matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels, and sklearn to support development, analysis, and visualization of state-of-the-art trading systems.
