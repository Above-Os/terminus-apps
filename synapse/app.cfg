  fullDescription: |
    Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver developed from 2019 through 2023 as part of the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix.org Foundation is not able to resource maintenance of Synapse and it continues to be developed by Element; additionally you have the choice of other Matrix homeservers.

  upgradeDescription: |
    Synapse 1.98.0 will be the last Synapse release in 2023; the regular release cadence will resume in January 2024.

    Synapse will soon be forked by Element under an AGPLv3.0 licence (with CLA, for proprietary dual licensing). You can read more about this here:
    https://matrix.org/blog/2023/11/06/future-of-synapse-dendrite/
    https://element.io/blog/element-to-adopt-agplv3/

    The Matrix.org Foundation copy of the project will be archived. Any changes needed by server administrators will be communicated via our usual announcements channels, but we are striving to make this as seamless as possible.

    No significant changes since 1.98.0rc1.
