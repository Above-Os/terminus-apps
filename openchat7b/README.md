## Description

This repo contains GGUF format model files for [OpenChat's Openchat 3.5 1210](https://huggingface.co/openchat/openchat-3.5-1210).

These files were quantised using hardware kindly provided by [Massed Compute](https://massedcompute.com/).

## Prompt template: OpenChat-Correct

```
GPT4 Correct User: {prompt}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:
```

## Compatibility

These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit [d0cee0d](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221)

They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.

## Usage
### Conversation templates

üí° **Default Mode (GPT4 Correct)**: Best for coding, chat and general tasks

```
GPT4 Correct User: Hello<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant: Hi<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct User: How are you today?<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:
```

üßÆ **Mathematical Reasoning Mode**: Tailored for solving math problems

```
Math Correct User: 10.3 ‚àí 7988.8133=<|end_of_turn|>Math Correct Assistant:
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice:** Remember to set `<|end_of_turn|>` as end of generation token.

The default (GPT4 Correct) template is also available as the integrated `tokenizer.chat_template`,
which can be used instead of manually specifying the template:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How are you today?"}
]
tokens = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)
assert tokens == [1, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 22557, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 15359, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 1602, 460, 368, 3154, 28804, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747]
```

## (Experimental) Evaluator / Feedback Capabilities

We've included evaluator capabilities in this release to advance open-source models as evaluators. You can use `Default Mode (GPT4 Correct)` with the following prompt (same as [Prometheus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kaist-ai/Feedback-Collection)) to evaluate a response.

```
###Task Description:
An instruction (might include an Input inside it), a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.
2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5. You should refer to the score rubric.
3. The output format should look as follows: "Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria) [RESULT] (an integer number between 1 and 5)"
4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.

###The instruction to evaluate:
{orig_instruction}

###Response to evaluate:
{orig_response}

###Reference Answer (Score 5):
{orig_reference_answer}

###Score Rubrics:
[{orig_criteria}]
Score 1: {orig_score1_description}
Score 2: {orig_score2_description}
Score 3: {orig_score3_description}
Score 4: {orig_score4_description}
Score 5: {orig_score5_description}

###Feedback:

Evaluation Details
```
*: ChatGPT (March) results are from [GPT-4 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774), [Chain-of-Thought Hub](https://github.com/FranxYao/chain-of-thought-hub), and our evaluation. Please note that ChatGPT is not a fixed baseline and evolves rapidly over time.

^: Zephyr-Œ≤ often fails to follow few-shot CoT instructions, likely because it was aligned with only chat data but not trained on few-shot data.

**: Mistral and Open-source SOTA results are taken from reported results in instruction-tuned model papers and official repositories.

All models are evaluated in chat mode (e.g. with the respective conversation template applied). All zero-shot benchmarks follow the same setting as in the AGIEval paper and Orca paper. CoT tasks use the same configuration as Chain-of-Thought Hub, HumanEval is evaluated with EvalPlus, and MT-bench is run using FastChat. To reproduce our results, follow the instructions in [our repository](https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/#benchmarks).

## Limitations

**Foundation Model Limitations**
Despite its advanced capabilities, OpenChat is still bound by the limitations inherent in its foundation models. These limitations may impact the model's performance in areas such as:

- Complex reasoning
- Mathematical and arithmetic tasks
- Programming and coding challenges

**Hallucination of Non-existent Information**
OpenChat may sometimes generate information that does not exist or is not accurate, also known as "hallucination". Users should be aware of this possibility and verify any critical information obtained from the model.

**Safety**
OpenChat may sometimes generate harmful, hate speech, biased responses, or answer unsafe questions. It's crucial to apply additional AI safety measures in use cases that require safe and moderated responses.
