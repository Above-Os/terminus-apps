## Thanks, and how to contribute

Thanks to the [chirper.ai](https://chirper.ai) team!

Thanks to Clay from [gpus.llm-utils.org](llm-utils)!

I've had a lot of people ask if they can contribute. I enjoy providing models and helping people, and would love to be able to spend even more time doing it, as well as expanding into new projects like fine tuning/training.

If you're able and willing to contribute it will be most gratefully received and will help me to keep providing more models, and to start work on new AI projects.

Donaters will get priority support on any and all AI/LLM/model questions and requests, access to a private Discord room, plus other benefits.
