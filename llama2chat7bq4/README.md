### About GGUF

GGUF is a new format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21st 2023. It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp. GGUF offers numerous advantages over GGML, such as better tokenisation, and support for special tokens. It is also supports metadata, and is designed to be extensible.

Here is an incomplate list of clients and libraries that are known to support GGUF:

* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). The source project for GGUF. Offers a CLI and a server option.
* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), the most widely used web UI, with many features and powerful extensions. Supports GPU acceleration.
* [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), a fully featured web UI, with GPU accel across all platforms and GPU architectures. Especially good for story telling.
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), an easy-to-use and powerful local GUI for Windows and macOS (Silicon), with GPU acceleration.
* [LoLLMS Web UI](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui), a great web UI with many interesting and unique features, including a full model library for easy model selection.
* [Faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev/), an attractive and easy to use character-based chat GUI for Windows and macOS (both Silicon and Intel), with GPU acceleration.
* [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible AI server.
* [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server.
* [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), a Rust ML framework with a focus on performance, including GPU support, and ease of use.

## Compatibility

These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit [d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221)

They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.

## Explanation of quantisation methods
<details>
  <summary>Click to see details</summary>

The new methods available are:
* GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)
* GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - "type-0" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - "type-1" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - "type-1" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw
* GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - "type-0" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw

## How to download GGUF files

**Note for manual downloaders:** You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.

The following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:
- LM Studio
- LoLLMS Web UI
- Faraday.dev

### In `text-generation-webui`

Under Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: llama-2-7b-chat.q4_K_M.gguf.

Then click Download.

### On the command line, including multiple files at once

I recommend using the `huggingface-hub` Python library:

```shell
pip3 install huggingface-hub>=0.17.1
```

Then you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:

```shell
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

<details>
  <summary>More advanced huggingface-cli download usage</summary>

You can also download multiple files at once with a pattern:

```shell
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False --include='*Q4_K*gguf'
```

For more documentation on downloading with `huggingface-cli`, please see: [HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download#download-from-the-cli).

To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install `hf_transfer`:

```shell
pip3 install hf_transfer
```

And set environment variable `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` to `1`:

```shell
HUGGINGFACE_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF llama-2-7b-chat.q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Windows CLI users: Use `set HUGGINGFACE_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` before running the download command.
</details>

<!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-run start -->
## Example `llama.cpp` command

Make sure you are using `llama.cpp` from commit [d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221) or later.

```shell
./main -ngl 32 -m llama-2-7b-chat.q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 4096 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p "[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe.  Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.\n<</SYS>>\n{prompt}[/INST]"
```

Change `-ngl 32` to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.

Change `-c 4096` to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically.

If you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the `-p <PROMPT>` argument with `-i -ins`

For other parameters and how to use them, please refer to [the llama.cpp documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md)

## How to run in `text-generation-webui`

Further instructions here: [text-generation-webui/docs/llama.cpp.md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/llama.cpp.md).

## How to run from Python code

You can use GGUF models from Python using the [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) or [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) libraries.

### How to load this model from Python using ctransformers

#### First install the package

```bash
# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration
pip install ctransformers>=0.2.24
# Or with CUDA GPU acceleration
pip install ctransformers[cuda]>=0.2.24
# Or with ROCm GPU acceleration
CT_HIPBLAS=1 pip install ctransformers>=0.2.24 --no-binary ctransformers

# Original model card: Meta Llama 2's Llama 2 7B Chat

# **Llama 2**
Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.

## Model Details
*Note: Use of this model is governed by the Meta license. In order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the [website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and accept our License before requesting access here.*

Meta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.

**Model Developers** Meta

**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.

**Input** Models input text only.

**Output** Models generate text only.

**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.


||Training Data|Params|Content Length|GQA|Tokens|LR|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|7B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|
|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|13B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|
|Llama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|70B|4k|&#10004;|2.0T|1.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|

*Llama 2 family of models.* Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.

**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.

**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.

**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)

**Research Paper** ["Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models"](arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)

## Intended Use
**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.

To get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212).

**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.

## Hardware and Software
**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.

**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.

||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO<sub>2</sub>eq)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|
|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|
|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|
|Total|3311616||539.00|

**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.

## Training Data
**Overview** Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.

**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.

## Evaluation Results

In this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.
