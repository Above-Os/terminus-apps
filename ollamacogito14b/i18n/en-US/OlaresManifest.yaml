    ## MODEL OVERVIEW ##
    Built on Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA), Cogito models don't just search longerâ€”they develop better intuition through self-improvement, paving the way to superintelligence.

    Cogito v1 Preview is a family of hybrid reasoning models by Deep Cogito that outperform the best available open models of the same size, including counterparts from LLaMA, DeepSeek, and Qwen across most standard benchmarks.

    # Models
    We are releasing the strongest LLMs of sizes 3B, 8B, 14B, 32B and 70B

    # Features
    ITERATIVE SELF-IMPROVEMENT
    - First reasoning models to improve core intelligence, not just search time
    - Models develop stronger "intuition" through distillation of reasoning processes
    - 60% shorter reasoning chains than DeepSeek R1 with superior performance

    BREAKTHROUGH EFFICIENCY
    - Complete model family trained for <$3.5M total cost
    - Significantly more efficient than capital-intensive approaches
    - Proves superintelligence research is accessible, not just for big tech

    OPEN SUPERINTELLIGENCE
    - All models released under open license for commercial use
    - Complete transparency in reasoning process with <think> tags
    - Build on our research or deploy anywhere without restrictions
