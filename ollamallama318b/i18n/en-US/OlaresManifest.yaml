    ## MODEL OVERVIEW ##
    The Meta Llama 3.1 collection of multilingual large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative models in 8B, 70B and 405B sizes (text in/text out). The Llama 3.1 instruction tuned text only models (8B, 70B, 405B) are optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source and closed chat models on common industry benchmarks.

    # Models
    Llama 3.1 family of models available:
    - 8B
    - 70B
    - 405B

    Llama 3.1 405B is the first openly available model that rivals the top AI models when it comes to state-of-the-art capabilities in general knowledge, steerability, math, tool use, and multilingual translation.
    The upgraded versions of the 8B and 70B models are multilingual and have a significantly longer context length of 128K, state-of-the-art tool use, and overall stronger reasoning capabilities. This enables Metaâ€™s latest models to support advanced use cases, such as long-form text summarization, multilingual conversational agents, and coding assistants.
