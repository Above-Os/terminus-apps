  fullDescription: Radarr can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface
    with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured
    to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better
    quality format becomes available. Note that only one type of a given movie is
    supported. If you want both an 4k version and 1080p version of a given movie you
    will need multiple instances.
