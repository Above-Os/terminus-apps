  fullDescription: |
    Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool designed to make organizing events and meetings easier.

    Schedule group meetings with friends, colleagues and teams. Create meeting polls to find the best date and time to organize an event based on your participants' availability. Save time and avoid back-and-forth emails.

    # Important Note
    After installing the app, you must configure the SMTP service and restart the container; otherwise, registration emails will not be sent. 
    
    To do this, open the Control-Hub, navigate to Browse > Rally > ConfigMap, find rallly-config, click Edit YAML, and configure the SMTP-related fields.
