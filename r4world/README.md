**KEY FEATURES**

- **Security and Privacy First**: This recommendation workflow only requires an internet connection for installation and upgrades. All recommendation processes operate on your local Terminus Edge, ensuring no data is sent to third-party servers. Your personal behavioral data is encrypted and stored locally for added security.

- **Personalized Content Curation**: This recommendation algorithm learns from your interactions, such as reads, likes, and bookmarks, to create a dynamic user profile. It will automatically adjust recommendations based on changes in your behavior and global news trends.

- **Easy Monitoring**: This recommendation workflow utilize a simple and clear workflow to coordinate the entire content filtering and sorting process. Detailed logs are collected, providing a clear and concise view of all ongoing processes. This improves workflow transparency, assisting you in understanding what kind of content is being filtered out, and preventing information cocoons.

- **Lightweight Design**: This recommendation workflow utilizes a classical recommendation process to achieve better results while using minimal resources. It encompasses essential processes like recall, pre-rank, and rank. The workflow also leverages embedding results from content providers to further conserve computational resources.

**WORKFLOW OVERVIEW**

This recommendation workflow is developed under the Terminus Recommend Protocol, which is designed with privacy protection in mind.

Upon installing this recommendation from the Terminus Market, all processes run in offline sandboxs. As the data first syncs in an unfiltered package, then gets filtered and sorted on your local Terminus edge, the content provider will not be uninformed about your interests. This design ensures the maximum protection of your privacy.

This recommendation algorithm comprises 2 types of workflows, each with a few steps:

- Recommendation Workflows: 
    - Executes every 10 minutes, provides you the most recent news.
    - Includes recall, pre-rank, and rank processes. 
        - The recall processe eliminates irrelevant content, leaving approximately 10,000 articles for further sorting.
        - The pre-rank processe sorts the recalled content and fetches the full text of top articles. 
        - The rank processe then fine-tunes the order based on the full-text content, suggesting content that aligns best with your current interests.

- Training Workflow: 
    - Executes daily.
    - Uses behavioral data and global news trends to train the model used by in Recommendation Workflow

The recommended contents is stored on you loacl Terminus Edge, and can be accessed via Wise or other compatible reading apps.
