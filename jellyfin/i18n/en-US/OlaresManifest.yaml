  fullDescription: "Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control\
    \ of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary\
    \ Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices\
    \ via multiple apps. \n\nJellyfin enables you to collect, manage, and stream your\
    \ media. Run the Jellyfin server on your system and gain access to the leading\
    \ free-software entertainment system, bells and whistles included.\n\nWith Jellyfin,\
    \ you can\n* Enjoy your entire movie collection, easy to browse and with beautiful\
    \ artwork.\n* Watch your favorite shows, automatically sorted by season and ready\
    \ to binge.\n* Listen to music, your artists and your playlists, at home or on\
    \ the go.\n* Watch TV and set automatic recordings to expand your library.\n*\
    \ Read your books, comics, and magazines.\n* Organize your photos and share memories\
    \ with your friends and family.\n* Sharing a movie night remotely. It has never\
    \ been so easy.\n\nWhy Jellyfin\n# Privacy Focused\nJellyfin has no tracking,\
    \ phone-home, or central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our\
    \ software open and transparent. We're also not in the media business, so the\
    \ only media you see is your own.\n\n# Free Software\nJellyfin is Free Software,\
    \ licensed under the GNU GPL. You can use it, study it, modify it, build it, and\
    \ distribute it for free, as long as your changes are licensed the same way.\n\
    \n# No Fees\nThe Jellyfin server and official clients are free to download, now\
    \ and always. There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use Jellyfin, either\
    \ for yourself, for your friends, or for your company. All our incidental costs\
    \ are paid through donations from users like you.\n\n# Community Built\nThe project\
    \ relies entirely on contributions from volunteers. Want to help out? There's\
    \ lots of ways to do so, and you don't even have to code!\n"
