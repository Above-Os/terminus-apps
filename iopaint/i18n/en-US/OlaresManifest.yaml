  fullDescription: 'IOPaint is a free, open-source and fully self-hostable inpainting/outpainting
    tool powered by state-of-the-art AI models.


    You can employ a variety of models within IOPaint to alter images, encompassing
    modifications such as:


    Erase: Remove any unwanted object, defect, watermarks, people. I have also developed
    a macOS * iOS app called OptiClean that provides this feature.(https://opticlean.io/)


    Inpainting: Make modifications to specific parts of the image, add new objects,
    or replace anything on your pictures.


    Outpainting: Generate new pixels around your images to make it larger.
