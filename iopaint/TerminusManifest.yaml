  fullDescription: |
    IOPaint is a free, open-source and fully self-hostable inpainting/outpainting tool powered by state-of-the-art AI models.

    You can employ a variety of models within IOPaint to alter images, encompassing modifications such as:

    Erase: Remove any unwanted object, defect, watermarks, people. I have also developed a macOS * iOS app called OptiClean that provides this feature.(https://opticlean.io/)
    
    Inpainting: Make modifications to specific parts of the image, add new objects, or replace anything on your pictures.

    Outpainting: Generate new pixels around your images to make it larger.
