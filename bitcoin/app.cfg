  fullDescription: "Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download\
    \ and fully validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical\
    \ user interface, which can be optionally built.\nRun your Bitcoin node and independently\
    \ store and validate every single Bitcoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled\
    \ privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to ensure that your\
    \ wallet company can\u2019t spy on your transactions, or worse \u2014 lie to you.\n\
    \nPlus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire Bitcoin network\
    \ decentralized; win-win!\n\nWith over 20 advanced settings, you can take control\
    \ of your node and customize it to your needs. Control how your node connects\
    \ to other nodes over Tor, clearnet, and I2P, adjust your daily upload limit,\
    \ set the maximum mempool size, fine-tune its performance, and much more.\n\n\
    Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.\n"
