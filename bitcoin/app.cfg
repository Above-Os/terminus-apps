  fullDescription: |
    Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user interface, which can be optionally built.
    Run your Bitcoin node and independently store and validate every single Bitcoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to ensure that your wallet company can’t spy on your transactions, or worse — lie to you.

    Plus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire Bitcoin network decentralized; win-win!

    With over 20 advanced settings, you can take control of your node and customize it to your needs. Control how your node connects to other nodes over Tor, clearnet, and I2P, adjust your daily upload limit, set the maximum mempool size, fine-tune its performance, and much more.

    Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.
