  fullDescription: |
    EasyPhoto is a Webui UI plugin for generating AI portraits that can be used to train digital doppelgangers relevant to you. Training is recommended to be done with 5 to 20 portrait images, preferably half-body photos, and do not wear glasses (It doesn't matter if the characters in a few pictures wear glasses). After the training is done, we can generate it in the Inference section. We support using preset template images or uploading your own images for Inference.

    Features:
    Generate AI portraits in different style
    Multi-people Generation
    Support Video Inference
    SDXL Training and Inference
    Use LCM-Lora based sampling acceleration
    Support different base models for training and inference
