spec:
  fullDescription: 'EasyPhoto is a Webui UI plugin for generating AI portraits that
    can be used to train digital doppelgangers relevant to you. Training is recommended
    to be done with 5 to 20 portrait images, preferably half-body photos, and do not
    wear glasses (It doesn''t matter if the characters in a few pictures wear glasses).
    After the training is done, we can generate it in the Inference section. We support
    using preset template images or uploading your own images for Inference.
