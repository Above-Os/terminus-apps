  fullDescription: |
    Stirling-PDF is a robust, locally hosted web-based PDF manipulation tool using Docker. It enables you to carry out various operations on PDF files, including splitting, merging, converting, reorganizing, adding images, rotating, compressing, and more. This locally hosted web application has evolved to encompass a comprehensive set of features, addressing all your PDF requirements.

    All files and PDFs exist either exclusively on the client side, reside in server memory only during task execution, or temporarily reside in a file solely for the execution of the task. Any file downloaded by the user will have been deleted from the server by that point.

    Features
    50+ PDF Operations
    Parallel file processing and downloads
    Dark mode support
    Custom download options
    Custom 'Pipelines' to run multiple features in a automated queue
    API for integration with external scripts
