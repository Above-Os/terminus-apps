    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared app. Once installed by the Olares Admin, all users in the cluster can use it through reference app.

    ## MODEL OVERVIEW ##
    The GLM-4.5 series models are foundation models designed for intelligent agents. GLM-4.5-Air adopts a more compact design with 106 billion total parameters and 12 billion active parameters.

    GLM-4.5-Air unify reasoning, coding, and intelligent agent capabilities to meet the complex demands of intelligent agent applications. It is hybrid reasoning model that provide two modes: thinking mode for complex reasoning and tool usage, and non-thinking mode for immediate responses.

    # Features
    Mixture-of-Experts Architecture
    - 106B total parameters with only 312B active per inference, delivering massive scale with efficient computation.

    GLM-4.5 Hybrid Reasoning
    - Unique dual-mode system: "thinking" mode for complex analysis and "non-thinking" mode for instant responses.

    Native Tool Calling
    - Built-in support for function calling, web browsing, code execution, and external API integration.

    Advanced Coding
    - Full-stack development capabilities from frontend to backend, with 90.6% tool-use success rate in coding tasks.

    Multilingual
    - Trained on 24+ languages with exceptional English-Chinese bilingual capabilities and strong alignment.

    Open Source
    - MIT license allows unlimited commercial use, self-hosting, and customization without API dependencies.
