    # Overview
    Medusa is a commerce platform with a built-in framework for customization that allows you to build custom commerce applications without reinventing core commerce logic. The framework and modules can be used to support advanced B2B or DTC commerce stores, marketplaces, distributor platforms, PoS systems, service businesses, or similar solutions that need foundational commerce primitives. All commerce modules are open-source and freely available on npm.

    Medusa ships with three main tools:
    - A suite of Commerce Modules with core commerce functionalities, such as tracking inventory, calculating cart totals, accepting payments, managing orders, and much more.
    - A Framework for building custom functionalities specific to your business, product, or industry. This includes tools for introducing custom API endpoints, business logic, and data models; building workflows and automations; and integrating with third-party services.
    - A customizable admin dashboard for merchants to configure and operate their store.

    # Fixes regression with link migrations

    This release fixes a regression in type generation during builds that could cause build failures under certain conditions. In PR #14493, we updated the build process to generate Medusa’s autogenerated types at build time, ensuring they are available both during development and in production.

    This change introduced an unintended issue in the build process. Generating types during the build requires bootstrapping the application. During bootstrap, several core internal loaders are executed, including those responsible for establishing database connections. These loaders depend on specific environment variables, and when those variables are not present, the build fails.

    This release changes the types generation to rely on a “lightweight” bootstrap mode , which allows the application to start without executing these core internal loaders, avoiding the dependency on environment variables during the build phase.
