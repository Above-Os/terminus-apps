  fullDescription: |
    CrewAI: Production-grade framework for orchestrating sophisticated AI agent systems. From simple automations to complex real-world applications, CrewAI provides precise control and deep customization. By fostering collaborative intelligence through flexible, production-ready architecture, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex business challenges with predictable, consistent results.


    Key Features
    - Deep Customization: Build sophisticated agents with full control over the system - from overriding inner prompts to accessing low-level APIs. Customize roles, goals, tools, and behaviors while maintaining clean abstractions.
    - Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enabling complex problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
    - Flexible Task Management: Define and customize tasks with granular control, from simple operations to complex multi-step processes.
    - Production-Grade Architecture: Support for both high-level abstractions and low-level customization, with robust error handling and state management.
    - Predictable Results: Ensure consistent, accurate outputs through programmatic guardrails, agent training capabilities, and flow-based execution control. See our documentation on guardrails for implementation details.
    - Model Flexibility: Run your crew using OpenAI or open source models with production-ready integrations. See Connect CrewAI to LLMs for detailed configuration options.
    - Event-Driven Flows: Build complex, real-world workflows with precise control over execution paths, state management, and conditional logic.
    - Process Orchestration: Achieve any workflow pattern through flows - from simple sequential and hierarchical processes to complex, custom orchestration patterns with conditional branching and parallel execution.
