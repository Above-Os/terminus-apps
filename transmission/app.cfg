  fullDescription: |
    Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with its users to make money: Transmission doesn't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools, or anything else. It doesn't hold some features back for a payware version. Its source code is available for anyone to review. We don't track our users, and our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.
