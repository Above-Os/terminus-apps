  fullDescription: 'Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike
    some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn''t play games with its users to make
    money: Transmission doesn''t bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools,
    or anything else. It doesn''t hold some features back for a payware version. Its
    source code is available for anyone to review. We don''t track our users, and
    our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.
