spec:
  fullDescription: "Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization\
    \ plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB as\
    \ the server.\nNote: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official \"Obsidian\
    \ Sync\".\n\n# Features\n- Synchronize vaults very efficiently with less traffic.\n\
    \n- Good at conflicted modification. \n  * Automatic merging for simple conflicts.\n\
    \n- Using OSS solution for the server. \n  * Compatible solutions can be used.\n\
    \n- Supporting End-to-end encryption.\n\n- Synchronisation of settings, snippets,\
    \ themes, and plug-ins, via Customization sync(Beta) or Hidden File Sync\n\n-\
    \ WebClip from obsidian-livesync-webclip\n\nThis plug-in might be useful for researchers,\
    \ engineers, and developers with a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted\
    \ for security reasons. Or just anyone who would like the peace of mind of knowing\
    \ that their notes are fully private.\n\n# Important\n- Before installing or upgrading\
    \ this plug-in, please back your vault up.\n- Do not enable this plugin with another\
    \ synchronization solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).\n\
    - This is a synchronization plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this\
    \ for backup.\n"
  upgradeDescription: "Fixed:\n- Fixed the issue that binary files were sometimes\
    \ corrupted.\n- Fixed customisation sync data could be corrupted.\n  Please let\
    \ me know if you find anything strange about these two fixes. It is getting a\
    \ bit complicated in this area.\n\nImproved:\n- Now the remote database costs\
    \ lower memory. (#382)\n- This release requires a brief wait on the first synchronisation,\
    \ to track the latest changeset again.\n- Description added for the Device name.\
    \ (#391)\n\nRefactored:\n- Many type-errors have been resolved.\n- Obsolete file\
    \ has been deleted.\n\nCheck the full release note at: https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/releases/tag/0.22.16\n"
