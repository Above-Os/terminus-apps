  fullDescription: |
    Fooocus is an image generator, which is offline, open source, and free. It is similar to many online image generators like Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images. 

    Why Fooocus
    - User-Centric Design: Fooocus is all about simplicity and effectiveness. It eliminates the need for manual tweaking, allowing you to focus purely on your creative prompts.
    
    - Innovative Blend: Incorporating the best features of Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, Fooocus offers an offline, open-source platform that's both versatile and powerful.
    
    - Diverse Creative Options: With options for anime or realistic styles, Fooocus caters to a wide range of artistic preferences, making it a versatile tool for various art forms.

    Main Models
    - General: juggernautXL_v8Rundiffusion
    - Realistic: realisticStockPhoto_v20
    - Anime: animaPencilXL_v500

    Important Notes
    The Fooocus project is built entirely on the Stable Diffusion XL architecture. There are no current plans to migrate to or incorporate newer model architectures.
