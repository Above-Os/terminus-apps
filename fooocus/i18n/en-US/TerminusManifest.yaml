spec:
  fullDescription: "Fooocus is an image generator, which is offline, open source,\
    \ and free. It is similar to many online image generators like Midjourney, the\
    \ manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and\
    \ images. \n\nWhy Fooocus\n- User-Centric Design: Fooocus is all about simplicity\
    \ and effectiveness. It eliminates the need for manual tweaking, allowing you\
    \ to focus purely on your creative prompts.\n\n- Innovative Blend: Incorporating\
    \ the best features of Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, Fooocus offers an offline,\
    \ open-source platform that's both versatile and powerful.\n\n- Diverse Creative\
    \ Options: With options for anime or realistic styles, Fooocus caters to a wide\
    \ range of artistic preferences, making it a versatile tool for various art forms.\n\
    \nMain Models\n- General: juggernautXL_v8Rundiffusion\n- Realistic: realisticStockPhoto_v20\n\
    - Anime: animaPencilXL_v500\n\nImportant Notes\nThe Fooocus project is built entirely\
    \ on the Stable Diffusion XL architecture. There are no current plans to migrate\
    \ to or incorporate newer model architectures.\n"
