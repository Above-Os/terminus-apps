  fullDescription: |
    Open WebUI(Formerly Ollama WebUI) is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted WebUI designed to operate entirely offline. It supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs. For more information, be sure to check out our Open WebUI Documentation.

    Key Features of Open WebUI
    - Ollama/OpenAI API Integration: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. Customize the OpenAI API URL to link with LMStudio, GroqCloud, Mistral, OpenRouter, and more.

    - Pipelines, Open WebUI Plugin Support: Seamlessly integrate custom logic and Python libraries into Open WebUI using Pipelines Plugin Framework. Launch your Pipelines instance, set the OpenAI URL to the Pipelines URL, and explore endless possibilities. Examples include Function Calling, User Rate Limiting to control access, Usage Monitoring with tools like Langfuse, Live Translation with LibreTranslate for multilingual support, Toxic Message Filtering and much more.

    - Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience across Desktop PC, Laptop, and Mobile devices.

    - Progressive Web App (PWA) for Mobile: Enjoy a native app-like experience on your mobile device with our PWA, providing offline access on localhost and a seamless user interface.

    - Full Markdown and LaTeX Support: Elevate your LLM experience with comprehensive Markdown and LaTeX capabilities for enriched interaction.

    - Hands-Free Voice/Video Call: Experience seamless communication with integrated hands-free voice and video call features, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive chat environment.

    - Model Builder: Easily create Ollama models via the Web UI. Create and add custom characters/agents, customize chat elements, and import models effortlessly through Open WebUI Community integration.

    - Native Python Function Calling Tool: Enhance your LLMs with built-in code editor support in the tools workspace. Bring Your Own Function (BYOF) by simply adding your pure Python functions, enabling seamless integration with LLMs.

    - Local RAG Integration: Dive into the future of chat interactions with groundbreaking Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. This feature seamlessly integrates document interactions into your chat experience. You can load documents directly into the chat or add files to your document library, effortlessly accessing them using the # command before a query.

    - Web Search for RAG: Perform web searches using providers like SearXNG, Google PSE, Brave Search, serpstack, serper, Serply, DuckDuckGo and TavilySearch and inject the results directly into your chat experience.

    - Web Browsing Capability: Seamlessly integrate websites into your chat experience using the # command followed by a URL. This feature allows you to incorporate web content directly into your conversations, enhancing the richness and depth of your interactions.

    - Image Generation Integration: Seamlessly incorporate image generation capabilities using options such as AUTOMATIC1111 API or ComfyUI (local), and OpenAI's DALL-E (external), enriching your chat experience with dynamic visual content.

    - Many Models Conversations: Effortlessly engage with various models simultaneously, harnessing their unique strengths for optimal responses. Enhance your experience by leveraging a diverse set of models in parallel.

    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensure secure access with restricted permissions; only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, and exclusive model creation/pulling rights are reserved for administrators.

    - Multilingual Support: Experience Open WebUI in your preferred language with our internationalization (i18n) support. Join us in expanding our supported languages! We're actively seeking contributors!

    - Continuous Updates: We are committed to improving Open WebUI with regular updates, fixes, and new features.

  upgradeDescription: |
    **Database Migrations**: This release includes database schema changes; we strongly recommend backing up your database and all associated data before upgrading in production environments. If you are running a multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployment, all instances must be updated simultaneously, rolling updates are not supported and will cause application failures due to schema incompatibility.

    Upgrade app version to 0.8.1

    Added
    - **Channel user active status.** Checking user active status in channels is now faster thanks to optimized database queries.
    - **Responses API endpoint with model routing.** The OpenAI API proxy now supports a /responses endpoint that routes requests to the correct backend based on the model field in the request, instead of always using the first configured endpoint. This enables support for backends like vLLM that provide /skills and /v1/responses endpoints.
    - **Model and prompt list optimization.** Improved performance when loading models and prompts by pre-fetching user group IDs once instead of making multiple database queries.
    - **Batch access control queries.** Improved performance when loading models, prompts, and knowledge bases by replacing multiple individual access checks with single batch queries, significantly reducing database load for large deployments.
    - **Faster user list loading.** User lists now load significantly faster by deferring profile image loading; images are fetched separately in parallel by the browser, improving caching and reducing database load.
    - **Web search result count.** The built-in search_web tool now respects the admin-configured "Search Result Count" setting instead of always returning 5 results when using Native Function Calling mode.
    - **SCIM externalId support.** SCIM-enabled deployments can now store and manage externalId for user provisioning, enabling better integration with identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID and Okta.
    - **Translation updates.** Portuguese (Brazil) translations were updated.

    Fixed
    - **Public sharing security fix.** Fixed a security issue where users with write access could see the Public sharing option regardless of their actual public sharing permission, and direct API calls could bypass frontend sharing restrictions.
    - **Direct model access control fix.** Model access control changes now persist correctly for direct Ollama and OpenAI models that don't have database entries, and error messages display properly instead of showing "[object Object]".
    - **Reasoning trace rendering performance.** Reasoning traces from models now render properly without being split into many fragments, preventing browser slowdowns during streaming responses.
    - **ARM device compatibility fix.** Fixed an issue where upgrading to 0.8.0 would fail to start on ARM devices (like Raspberry Pi 4) due to torch 2.10.0 causing SIGILL errors; now pinned to torch<=2.9.1.
    - **Skills PostgreSQL compatibility fix.** Fixed a PostgreSQL compatibility issue where creating or listing skills would fail with a TypeError, while SQLite worked correctly.
    - **PostgreSQL analytics query fix.** Fixed an issue where retrieving chat IDs by model ID would fail on PostgreSQL due to incompatible DISTINCT ordering, while SQLite worked correctly.
    - **SQLite cascade delete fix.** Deleting chats now properly removes all associated messages in SQLite, matching PostgreSQL behavior and preventing orphaned data.
    - **Ollama Cloud model naming fix.** Fixed an issue where using Ollama Cloud models would fail with "Model not found" errors because ":latest" was incorrectly appended to model names.
    - **Knowledge selector tooltip z-index.** Fixed an issue where tooltips in the "Select Knowledge" dropdown were hidden behind the menu, making it difficult to read knowledge item names and descriptions.
    - **Model selector scroll position.** The model selector dropdown now correctly scrolls to and centers the currently selected model when opened, and resets scroll position when reopened.
    - **Sync modal unexpected appearance.** Fixed an issue where the Sync Modal would appear unexpectedly after enabling the "Community Sharing" feature if the user had previously visited the app with the sync parameter.
    - **Knowledge collection layout fix.** Fixed a layout issue in the Knowledge integration menu where long collection names caused indentation artifacts and now properly truncate with ellipsis.
    - **Metadata processing crash fix.** Fixed a latent bug where processing document metadata containing certain keys (content, pages, tables, paragraphs, sections, figures) would cause a RuntimeError due to dictionary mutation during iteration.
    - **Password validation regex fix.** Fixed the password validation regex by adding the raw string prefix, ensuring escape sequences like d and w are interpreted correctly.
