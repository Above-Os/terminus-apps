  fullDescription: |
    LlamaIndex (GPT Index) is a data framework for your LLM application. Building with LlamaIndex typically involves working with LlamaIndex core and a chosen set of integrations (or plugins). 

    LlamaIndex imposes no restriction on how you use LLMs. You can use LLMs as auto-complete, chatbots, agents, and more. It just makes using them easier. We provide tools like:
    - Data connectors ingest your existing data from their native source and format. These could be APIs, PDFs, SQL, and (much) more.
    - Data indexes structure your data in intermediate representations that are easy and performant for LLMs to consume.
    - Engines provide natural language access to your data. For example:
    - Query engines are powerful interfaces for question-answering (e.g. a RAG flow).
    - Chat engines are conversational interfaces for multi-message, "back and forth" interactions with your data.
    - Agents are LLM-powered knowledge workers augmented by tools, from simple helper functions to API integrations and more.
    - Observability/Evaluation integrations that enable you to rigorously experiment, evaluate, and monitor your app in a virtuous cycle.
    - Workflows allow you to combine all of the above into an event-driven system far more flexible than other, graph-based approaches.
