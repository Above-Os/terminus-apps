    \  JXL support (closes #306, thanks to @tr7zw)\n  You can now configure Mango\
    \ through environment variables (thanks to @crainte). Overall precedence:\n  -\
    \ config file (if exists)\n  - environment variables\n  - default values (see\
    \ README.md)\n  An additional \"Page fit\" option for the paged reader (partially\
    \ #147, thanks to @Hiers)\n\n  Improvements\n  - Include a manga in the continue\
    \ reading section on the home page as long as there are unread entries, even if\

    \ a bug on the paged reader pre-loading (thanks to @Leeingnyo)\n  - Fixed a bug\
