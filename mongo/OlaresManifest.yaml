    New Features
      Mango now supports directory entries. In addition to archive files like cbz/cbr, you can simply put image files into a folder and Mango will recognize it as a manga entry (closes #215, thanks to @Leeingnyo)
      JXL support (closes #306, thanks to @tr7zw)
      You can now configure Mango through environment variables (thanks to @crainte). Overall precedence:
      - config file (if exists)
      - environment variables
      - default values (see README.md)
      An additional "Page fit" option for the paged reader (partially #147, thanks to @Hiers)

      Improvements
      - Include a manga in the continue reading section on the home page as long as there are unread entries, even if the last entry is marked as read (thanks to @torta)
      
      Bug-Fixes
      - Fixed a bug on the paged reader pre-loading (thanks to @Leeingnyo)
      - Fixed a bug where the subscribe button is showing for plugins that don't support manga subscriptions
      - Fixed a bug where the mango.attribute helper function for plugins does not work for some HTML (fixes #320)
      - Fixed a bug where the manifest.json file is missing from the binary (thanks to @phlhg)
