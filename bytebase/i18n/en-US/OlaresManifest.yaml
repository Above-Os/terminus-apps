    and Platform Engineering teams.
spec:
  fullDescription: "Bytebase is an open-source database DevOps tool, it's the GitLab/GitHub\
    \ for managing databases throughout the application development lifecycle. It\
    \ offers a web-based collaboration workspace for DBAs, Developers and platform\
    \ engineers.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS ## \nDifferent database development tasks\nMultiple\
    \ database systems\nUnified process\nSingle tool\n\n## KEY FEATURES ##\n* SQL\
    \ Review\n  Bytebase analyzes SQL changes to enforce rules in compliance with\
    \ your organization's policy. The enforcement includes naming conventions, anti-SQL\
    \ pattern detection and etc. Prod and non-prod environments can also enforce different\
    \ rules respectively.\n* Database CI/CD and Change Automation\n  Like code review,\
    \ Bytebase streamlines the database change process. Within a single workflow,\
    \ a database change can be reviewed and deployed from the dev environment all\
    \ the way to the production environment.\n* GitOps (Database-as-Code)\n  Bytebase\
    \ keeps the complete schema change history. It also integrates with VCS systems.\
    \ Teams can manage the SQL migration scripts in the VCS and trigger schema deployment\
    \ on code commit.\n* Batch Change and Query\n  Bytebase allows you to change a\
    \ collection of databases in a single workflow. It also allows you to issue a\
    \ single query against multiple databases.\n* SQL Editor\n  A web-based SQL Editor\
    \ to query and export data. DBAs no longer need to give away sensitive database\
    \ credentials when developers need to access the data.\n* Dynamic Data Masking\n\
    \  Bytebase provides multi-level masking policy with workflow to grant unmasked\
    \ data access.\n* Data Access Control\n  Bytebase provides a suite of features\
    \ to enable organizations to enforce data security policies, avoid data leaks\
    \ and conform compliance.\n* Data Rollback and Disaster Recovery\n  - Statement-level\
    \ rollback\n  - Database-level manual and periodical backup and restore\n  - Point-in-time\
    \ recovery (PITR)\n"
