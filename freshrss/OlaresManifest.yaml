  fullDescription: |
    FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator.
    It is lightweight, easy to work with, powerful, customizable, and has been translated into many languages.
    It is a multi-user application with an anonymous reading mode. It supports custom tags. There is an API for (mobile) clients, and a Command-Line Interface.
    Thanks to the WebSub standard, FreshRSS is able to receive instant push notifications from compatible sources, such as Friendica, WordPress, Blogger, Medium, etc.
    FreshRSS natively supports basic Web scraping, based on XPath, for Web sites not providing any RSS / Atom feed. Also supports JSON documents.
    FreshRSS offers the ability to reshare selections of articles by HTML, RSS, and OPML.
    Different login methods are supported: Web form (including an anonymous option), HTTP Authentication (compatible with proxy delegation), OpenID Connect.
    Finally, FreshRSS supports extensions for further tuning.
