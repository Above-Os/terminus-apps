    # Bug fix point release
    This release fixes a few bugs, most important one being the converting NULL to string is unsupported happening for users that updated their DBs directly. This fix is implemented as a change to the DB during Navidrome's startup that can take a few minutes, depending on the size of your library, so please be patient with large libraries.
