  fullDescription: "Firefly III\" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances.\
    \ It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less\
    \ and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags.\
    \ Using a bunch of external tools, you can import data. It also has many neat\
    \ financial reports available.\n\nFirefly III should give you insight into and\
    \ control over your finances. Money should be useful, not scary. You should be\
    \ able to see where it is going, to feel your expenses and to... wow, I'm going\
    \ overboard with this aren't I?\n\nBut you get the idea: this is your money. These\
    \ are your expenses. Stop them from controlling you. I built this tool because\
    \ I started to dislike money. Having money, not having money, paying bills with\
    \ money, you get the idea. But no more. I want to feel \"safe\", whatever my balance\
    \ is. And I hope this tool can help you. I know it helps me.\n\n# Features\nFirefly\
    \ III is pretty feature packed. Some important stuff first:\n- It is completely\
    \ self-hosted and isolated, and will never contact external servers until you\
    \ explicitly tell it to.\n- It features a REST JSON API that covers almost every\
    \ part of Firefly III.\n\nThe most exciting features are:\n- Create recurring\
    \ transactions to manage your money.\n- Rule based transaction handling with the\
    \ ability to create your own rules.\n\nAlso interesting:\n- A double-entry bookkeeping\
    \ system\n- You can store, edit and remove withdrawals, deposits and transfers.\
    \ This allows you full financial management\n- You can manage different types\
    \ of accounts\n- It's possible to create, change and manage money using budgets\n\
    - Organize transactions using categories\n- Save towards a goal using piggy banks\n\
    - Predict and anticipate bills\n- View income and expense reports\n- Organize\
    \ expenses using tags\n\nAnd the things you would hope for but not expect:\n-\
    \ 2-factor authentication for extra security\n- Supports any currency you want\n\
    \nAnd to organist everything:\n- Clear views that should show you how you're doing\n\
    - Easy navigation through your records\n- Browse back and forth to see previous\
    \ months or even years\n- Lots of charts because we all love them\n\nIf you feel\
    \ you\u2019re missing something you can just ask me, and I'll add it!\n"
