spec:
  fullDescription: "GaiaNet is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables\
    \ everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect\
    \ their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise. It allows individuals and businesses\
    \ to create AI agents. Each GaiaNet node provides    \n- a web-based chatbot UI.\n\
    - an OpenAI compatible API. \n\nKey Features    \n- Efficient Execution:\nGaiaNet\
    \ applications run in a secure, lightweight, and high-performance sandbox called\
    \ WasmEdge, ensuring efficient execution.\n\n- Support a wide range of LLM:\n\
    The GaiaNet node supports almost all open-source LLMs, multimodal models (eg Large\
    \ Vision Models or LVMs), text-to-image models (eg Stable Diffusion) and text-to-video\
    \ models. That includes all finetuned models using personal or proprietary data.\n\
    \n- Embedding Model: GaiaNet nodes manage a body of public or proprietary knowledge,\
    \ allowing AI agents to specialize in specific domains and outperform larger,\
    \ generalist models.\n\n- Privacy and Performance: Embedding vectors are stored\
    \ locally on the GaiaNet node, optimizing performance and maintaining maximum\
    \ privacy.\n\n- Prompt Engineering: Nodes enable prompt engineering, allowing\
    \ users to customize LLM behavior by providing examples of tasks.\n\n- OpenAI\
    \ API Compatible: All nodes have a standardized API for questions and answers,\
    \ facilitating load balancing and compatibility with a broad ecosystem of applications\
    \ that use the OpenAI API specification.\n"
